### Run the app in locally

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `Caveats`

- For the purpose of this exercise I have assumed that the api request do not have network errors.
- As the project is small in scale I decided to implement the styles with vanilla css.

### `Future Improvements`

- With more time I would
  - make the UI responsive for different screen sizes.
  - Add API UI for error handeling
  - I would have liked to write project in Typescript. As of now using Typescript would slow me down because I don't use it daily.
  - Add loading UI for pokemon images
  - make the Pokemon list UI better visually i.e. adding pokemon photos
- Sort Pokemon list alphabetically for better search experience for the users
